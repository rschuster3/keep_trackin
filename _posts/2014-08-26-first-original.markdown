<h3>Taft Bridge</h3>
<p align="justify">
  It's been raining all day. Water drains down into Rock Creek, turning it brown with dirt from hillsides and dry streets. Eventually
  the clouds thin and mist rises up from the valley, shining where droplets catch the sunset. I walk toward the mist, hoping to capture
  its play with the sunlight, but I'm too slow. As consolation, I wind my way down to the creek and watch lightning bugs as rushing water
  covers up the sound of traffic. It's night when I emerge from the forest by Taft Bridge and the air is heavy. Beams thrown by street lamps,
  normally invisible, are magnified, and the rain-slicked road is a pathway of head and tail lights.

  Space opens up here under the massive bridge and views are expansive. The cars are illuminated as they pass by, some up to lighted streets, others
  down into wooded darkness. I'm not alone: above me a pair of blue eyes watches, like Mr. Eckleburg in The Great Gatsby. Everyone here is in transit,
  enclosed in metal vehicles. Suddenly the openness of this place invades like a police officer's flash light and each individual is exposed. 
  Let me see your face. Where are you going? Everyone must pass scrutiny. At first I make the mistake of thinking I'm an observer and out of reach, 
  but I'm under the gaze of those blue eyes, too. Afterwards I pass on into the darkness, laid bare, shivering, and tired from the walk.
