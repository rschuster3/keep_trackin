<h3>Brick Kilns</h3>

<p>
  <br>
  Next to the National Arboretum's New York Avenue entrance sits a group of low brick buildings that resemble half-buried bee hives. They're so
  overgrown the entire site looks like a scene from Jurassic Park or Alien v. Predator (minus the non-humanoids). Despite its menacing and crumbling
  appearance, however, the abandoned United Brickyard Corporation offers few dangers apart from being a "No Trespassing" zone. Kilns that fed the
  post WWII construction boom now sit silent and cold.

  Inside, the kilns take on a Parthenon-like appearance, arching up to a single hole in the ceiling. Their doors are welded shut with the exception
  of one. It contains chairs, tables, and a poster ad for cigarettes - like its inhabitants were trying to simulate a local caf&eacute;. Rail tracks
  partition the area and act as convenient sidewalks, keeping the weeds at bay. The factory layout resembles the city it built, with transport routes
  connecting activity hubs and a central building overseeing everything. Men worked here around the hive-like structures, and even though this place
  is silent now it tells the story of how DC was built, changed, and moved on.
