  <h3>About</h3>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I'm Ryan Schuster: a D.C.-based web developer, meteorologist, and amateur photographer. For fun, I rent cars and drive to nearby places in search
     of interesting stories and forgotten history. So many people and events are buried in time. Unearthing their stories reminds us of what we've
	 forgotten and makes us question why we've forgotten it.</p>
